# Inteligentne Fiszki (Smart Flashcards)
PR TEST 2
[![Project Status: In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in_development-blueviolet.svg)](https://shields.io)

A web application designed to help students, especially those in AI and ML fields, efficiently create study materials. It addresses the time-consuming process of manual flashcard creation by leveraging AI to automatically generate question-and-answer pairs from user-provided text notes.

## üìñ Project Description

The core problem this application solves is the slow and tedious nature of creating high-quality educational flashcards. Many students have extensive digital notes but are discouraged from using spaced repetition‚Äîone of the most effective learning techniques‚Äîdue to the significant time investment required to prepare materials.

**Inteligentne Fiszki** streamlines this process by allowing users to paste their notes and receive AI-generated flashcard suggestions, minimizing effort and maximizing learning efficiency. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on essential features: AI generation, manual creation, card management, and a learning module based on the Leitner system.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

The project uses a modern tech stack focused on performance, developer experience, and scalability.

## üöÄ Getting Started Locally

To set up and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version `22.14.0` (as specified in the `.nvmrc` file). We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node versions.
- **Package Manager**: `npm`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`.
- **Supabase Account**: You will need a Supabase project for the database and authentication.
- **OpenRouter.ai Account**: You will need an API key to connect to the AI model provider.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/inteligentne-fiszki.git
    cd inteligentne-fiszki
    ```

2.  **Install the correct Node.js version (if using nvm):**

    ```sh
    nvm use
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Populate the `.env` file with your credentials from Supabase and OpenRouter:

    ```env
    # Supabase
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="your-supabase-project-url"
    PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-supabase-anon-key"

    # OpenRouter.ai
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your-openrouter-api-key"
    ```

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```sh
